# Rustyca

Get your lycamobile account's information right into your shell.

## Setup

Just create `~/.config/.rustyca_config.yml` and inside of it:

```
mobile-phone-number: 34666666563
password: lallero
```

## Note

I'm still learning Rust, it made this tool just for fun, any constructive feedback is very welcomed
